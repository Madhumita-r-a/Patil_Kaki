This is a basic website I created for my internship application.
i have used only html,css and js. I have to integrate it with reactjs soon.
this contains 3 files : index.html, style.css and script.js
index.html is the main file/source file which we have to run 
style.css is the cascading style sheet of the project
script.js is the javascript file for the project
